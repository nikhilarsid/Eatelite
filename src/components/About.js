        <h1>Serving Delicious Food Since 1960</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to our restaurant! Our journey began in 1960 with a small, family-owned pizzeria in the heart of the city. Over the decades, we have grown and evolved, but our commitment to serving mouth-watering, high-quality food has remained constant.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          It all started with our founder, John Doe, who had a passion for creating the perfect pizza. With a secret family recipe and a dream, John opened our first restaurant. The aroma of freshly baked pizza and the warm, inviting atmosphere quickly made it a local favorite.
        </p>
        <p>
          As word spread and demand grew, we expanded our menu to include a variety of Italian dishes, all made from scratch with the finest ingredients. From our homemade pasta to our decadent desserts, every dish is crafted with love and care.
        </p>
        <h2>From Restaurant to Your Doorstep</h2>
        <p>
